This code is a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with CSV files using the PandasAI library. 

Hereâ€™s a summary of its main functionalities:

1. **Imports**: The application imports necessary libraries, including Streamlit for the web interface, Pandas for data manipulation, and PandasAI for AI-driven data analysis.

2. **Session State Management**: It initializes a session state to keep track of the user's prompt history, allowing users to revisit previous prompts.

3. **Sidebar Configuration**: The sidebar includes:
   - A title and information about the application.
   - An input field for the OpenAI API key (required for AI functionalities).
   - Toggles for enabling explanations and clarification questions.
   - A file uploader for users to upload CSV files.

4. **Prompt History**: Users can view and select from their prompt history, and there is an option to clear the cache.

5. **Main Interface**: The main area of the app allows users to:
   - Upload a CSV file and read its contents into a DataFrame.
   - Select specific columns from the DataFrame for analysis.
   - Enter a prompt for the AI to process.

6. **Processing the Prompt**: When the user clicks the "Process" button:
   - It checks for the API key and the prompt.
   - It initializes the OpenAI model and the PandasAI agent.
   - The agent processes the prompt and returns a response, which can be an image or text.
   - If enabled, it provides explanations and clarification questions based on the prompt.

7. **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling for reading the CSV file and for missing prompts or API keys.

Overall, the application serves as an interactive tool for users to analyze and query their CSV data using AI capabilities.
